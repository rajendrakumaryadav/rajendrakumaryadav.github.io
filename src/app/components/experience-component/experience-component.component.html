      solutions using PHP, including frameworks such as CodeIgniter and
      Laravel.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-600">
      As a Web Developer at Narmware, I took a hands-on approach to develop

      microservices, where I played a key role in the adoption of Laravel and
      Docker as our primary development platforms. Leveraging Laravel's
      elegant syntax and Docker's containerization capabilities, I contributed
      to the creation of a scalable and maintainable microservices
